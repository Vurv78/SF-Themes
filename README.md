# SF-Themes
Textmate themes for Starfall

So far there's only a VSCode Dark+ theme, but that is a pretty good theme.  
Will do more when SF has the ability to get identifiers, error syntax and function arguments.  

You can use the dark theme and try and make your own theme to PR here.  
A lot of keys are specific and taken out for SF so I added comments as to what should be translated.

Note that the editor is missing support for a lot of things (Most notably constants "\_G, nil, true, false" and variables/identifiers.  
_This makes these themes not completely faithful to what you might see in your own editors._

Current List  
* VSCode Dark+
